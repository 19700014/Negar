									<h2>About me!</h2>
									<p>I am an Information technology student who is interested in coding and developing websites and applications. 
We had courses about MySQL which was about databases, C programming language, C++ programming language,HTML,JS,CSS and project management courses.<br>
since I am interested in website developing, I also took area elective courses such as python for web developing, WordPress.<br>
Since I’m also interested in art I have had a course about toy design and enjoy it a lot. Therefore, I also thought about how a technological toy would be provide.<br>

<h3> What are the security implications of the digital economy? </h3>
<p>As economies shift to digital and online models, threats can quickly outpace traditional approaches to data security. More than ever, governments and organizations need to be proactive in creating and adapting systems to face these threats. By safeguarding their own operations, the information of people who use their services will be better protected as well.</p>

The brief, written in close collaboration with Macmillan Keck, seeks to identify specific attributes of cybersecurity and data security frameworks that can help policymakers and regulators build a digital economy that includes — and serves — everyone.
<h3>What is a 'fully digital enterprise'? </h3>
<p>A Digital Enterprise is a business that has completed a digitalization strategy (aka, digital transformation) to fully incorporate digital tools and technologies across all aspects of their operations, from ideation thru realization to utilization.</p>
<h3> What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise? </h3>
<p> 1) Phishing Attacks<br>
The biggest, most damaging and most widespread threat facing small businesses is phishing attacks. Phishing accounts for 90% of all breaches that organizations face, they’ve grown 65% over the last year, and they account for over $12 billion in business losses.</p><br>
<p>
2) Malware Attacks<br>
Malware is the second big threat facing small businesses. It encompasses a variety of cyber threats such as trojans and viruses. Malware is a varied term for malicious code that hackers create to gain access to networks, steal data, or destroy data on computers. Malware usually comes from malicious website downloads, spam emails or from connecting to other infected machines or devices.</p><br>
<p> 3) Ransomware<br>
Ransomware is one of the most common cyber-attacks, hitting thousands of businesses every year. These attacks have only become more common,, as they are one of the most lucrative forms of attacks. Ransomware involves encrypting company data so that it cannot be used or accessed, and then forcing the company to pay a ransom to unlock the data. This leaves businesses with a tough choice – to pay the ransom and potentially lose huge sums of money, or cripple their services with a loss of data.
</p><br>
<p> 4) Weak Passwords<br>
Another big threat facing small businesses is employees using weak or easily guessed passwords. Many small businesses use multiple cloud based services, that require different accounts. These services often can contain sensitive data and financial information. Using easily guessed passwords, or using the same passwords for multiple accounts, can cause this data to become compromised. 
</p><br>
<p> 5) Insider Threats<br>
The final major threat facing small businesses is the insider threat. An insider threat is a risk to an organization that is caused by the actions of employees, former employees, business contractors or associates. These actors can access critical data about your company, and they can case harmful effects through greed or malice, or simply through ignorance and carelessness. Verizon found that 25% of data breaches were caused by insider threats.  </p><br>
<h3> Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022</h3>
Well in my opinion, the phenomenal we are facing can have several isuues which may be price changes and the economical issues. Although we are facing a war between Russia and ukrain that have cused sever change in energy prices besides the horrified death of people. Therefore, I cannot say that I’m aginst the mentioned on the title, however, I am not fully agree with the expression.

						<h2>Activity 5</h2>
<h3>Discuss the differences between OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities 2023 and IEEE Top 10 vulnerabilities 2021. </h3>

<h3>Top 10 OWASP 2023vulnerabilities:</h3>
<p>1.Broken object level authorization<br>
2.Broken authentication<br>3.Broken object property level authorization<br>4.Unrestricted resource consumption<br>5.Broken function level authorization<br>6.Server side request forgery<br>7.Security misconfiguration<br>8.Lack of protection from automated threats<br>9.Improper asset management<br>10.Unsafe consumption of APIs<br>
<h3>Top 10 IEEE 2021 vulnerabilities:</h3>
<p>1. Broken Access Control<br>2. Cryptographic Failures<br>3. Injection<br>4. Insecure Design<br>5. Security Misconfiguration<br>6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components<br>7. Identification and Authentication Failures<br>8. Software and Data Integrity Failures<br>9. Security Logging and Monitoring Features<br>10. Server-Side Request Forgery<br></p>
<h3>THEREFORE! <h3>
<p> I would like to mention that the vulnerabilities or in other word wick points of them in two period of time can show that the risks became more sophisticated to happen. Although there are still vulnerabilities for users that should be considered but knowing them make us to build a well organized protection for our developing project.</p>
