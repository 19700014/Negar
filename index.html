								<h3>overall</h3>
								<p>As you can see because of the errors I had, the codes didn’t work on my PC. However, I watched some videos on YouTube and asked my friends about the activity along with reading articles so that I could be able to understand the concept of the project. Therefore, as far as I understood honey pot have been using by people/organizations to practice how an attacker behave and sometimes for confusing the attacker. Therefore, in my opinion, we can define a honeypot system for our database and block every attack that would have happen to our website but it has some risks that can be detected by using both honeynet and honeypot.

    <img src="images/d3.jpeg" alt=""/>
							<h3>reflection</h3>
							<p>By doing researches about DDOS attacks first thing that came to my mind was the prevention not the detection and as far as I researched the best way is to use a strong firewall. As we all know DDOS attacks cause traffic in the system such as cars in a way that would be too many. Therefore, if we build a way with large amount of space the risk of having a DDOS attack will be reduced.</p>
									
							<h2>Activity4</h2>
<h3> What are the security implications of the digital economy? </h3>
<p>As economies shift to digital and online models, threats can quickly outpace traditional approaches to data security. More than ever, governments and organizations need to be proactive in creating and adapting systems to face these threats. By safeguarding their own operations, the information of people who use their services will be better protected as well.</p>

The brief, written in close collaboration with Macmillan Keck, seeks to identify specific attributes of cybersecurity and data security frameworks that can help policymakers and regulators build a digital economy that includes — and serves — everyone.
<h3>What is a 'fully digital enterprise'? </h3>
<p>A Digital Enterprise is a business that has completed a digitalization strategy (aka, digital transformation) to fully incorporate digital tools and technologies across all aspects of their operations, from ideation thru realization to utilization.</p>
<h3> What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise? </h3>
<p> 1) Phishing Attacks<br>
The biggest, most damaging and most widespread threat facing small businesses is phishing attacks. Phishing accounts for 90% of all breaches that organizations face, they’ve grown 65% over the last year, and they account for over $12 billion in business losses.</p><br>
<p>
2) Malware Attacks<br>
Malware is the second big threat facing small businesses. It encompasses a variety of cyber threats such as trojans and viruses. Malware is a varied term for malicious code that hackers create to gain access to networks, steal data, or destroy data on computers. Malware usually comes from malicious website downloads, spam emails or from connecting to other infected machines or devices.</p><br>
<p> 3) Ransomware<br>
Ransomware is one of the most common cyber-attacks, hitting thousands of businesses every year. These attacks have only become more common,, as they are one of the most lucrative forms of attacks. Ransomware involves encrypting company data so that it cannot be used or accessed, and then forcing the company to pay a ransom to unlock the data. This leaves businesses with a tough choice – to pay the ransom and potentially lose huge sums of money, or cripple their services with a loss of data.
</p><br>
<p> 4) Weak Passwords<br>
Another big threat facing small businesses is employees using weak or easily guessed passwords. Many small businesses use multiple cloud based services, that require different accounts. These services often can contain sensitive data and financial information. Using easily guessed passwords, or using the same passwords for multiple accounts, can cause this data to become compromised. 
</p><br>
<p> 5) Insider Threats<br>
The final major threat facing small businesses is the insider threat. An insider threat is a risk to an organization that is caused by the actions of employees, former employees, business contractors or associates. These actors can access critical data about your company, and they can case harmful effects through greed or malice, or simply through ignorance and carelessness. Verizon found that 25% of data breaches were caused by insider threats.  </p><br>
<h3> Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022</h3>
Well in my opinion, the phenomenal we are facing can have several isuues which may be price changes and the economical issues. Although we are facing a war between Russia and ukrain that have cused sever change in energy prices besides the horrified death of people. Therefore, I cannot say that I’m aginst the mentioned on the title, however, I am not fully agree with the expression.

	<h3>Impacting the ecosystem</h3>

<p>As more and more researchers have explored various vulnerabilities that exist within the Stagefright library and associated libraries, we expect to see more vulnerabilities in the same area. Many researchers in the community have said Google has replied to their reported bugs saying that they were duplicate or already discovered internally.

The research provided by Zimperium in this area has been a catalyst for change. Following our initial Stagefright announcement, industry-leading vendors made a clear statement that security updates will be provided on a monthly basis. So far, two monthly Nexus Security Bulletins have already posted. Next week will be the third.
	
	</p>
	<h3>Detecting attacks with z9</h3>

<p>At the heart of all Zimperium technology is our z9 engine, which has been trained with the capability to detect media processing attacks through all attack vectors. No additional update is required to detect this new pair of vulnerabilities. We are diligently monitoring sources for in-the-wild attacks.
	</p>
	<h4>reflection</h4>
	<p>The impact of vulnerabilities within the Stagefright library and associated libraries has prompted increased research and the discovery of more vulnerabilities in this area. Google has acknowledged some of these reported bugs as duplicates or already known internally. However, the research conducted by Zimperium has played a crucial role in driving change. The Stagefright announcement by Zimperium led to industry-leading vendors committing to providing monthly security updates. Two monthly Nexus Security Bulletins have already been released, with the third one scheduled for next week. Zimperium's z9 engine, at the core of their technology, is trained to detect media processing attacks across all attack vectors, including these new vulnerabilities. No additional update is necessary for z9 to identify these vulnerabilities, and Zimperium continues to actively monitor sources for real-world attacks.</p>
	<h3> identifying search options in Metasploit</h3>
  <img src="images/i1.jpg" alt="cc"/> 
  <img src="images/i2.jpg" alt="cc"/> 
  <img src="images/i3.jpg" alt="cc"/> 
  <h4>reflection</h4>
  <p>While identifying search options in Metasploit is essential for navigating and utilizing the framework effectively, it's important to note that it is just one aspect of using Metasploit for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Beyond search options, other critical factors come into play, such as understanding the vulnerabilities and exploits themselves, correctly configuring and executing modules, and interpreting the results obtained. Additionally, having a deep understanding of networking, systems, and security concepts is crucial to effectively utilize Metasploit and ensure accurate and reliable results. Therefore, while identifying search options is a vital skill, it is not the sole determinant of success in using Metasploit. A comprehensive understanding of the tool, coupled with strong technical expertise and methodologies, is equally important in conducting successful security assessments and evaluations.

 <h3> spoofing attack </h3>
 <img src="images/s1.jpg" alt="cc"/> 
 <img src="images/s2.jpg" alt="cc"/> 
 <img src="images/s3.jpg" alt="cc"/> 
 <h4>reflection</h4>
 <p> Confirming the spoofing attack in Wireshark involves using the tool to analyze network traffic and identify any signs of malicious activity. By examining packet headers, payload contents, and other network data, Wireshark can help detect anomalies that indicate the presence of a spoofing attack. This process enables network administrators and security professionals to validate the occurrence of a spoofing attack and take appropriate countermeasures to protect the network infrastructure. </p>
<br>
<p>To prevent spoofing attacks:

  Use network access controls, such as firewalls and ACLs, to restrict unauthorized access.
  Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of attacks.
  Deploy strong authentication mechanisms like 2FA or MFA.
  Utilize secure network protocols like SSH or SSL/TLS.
  Keep software and firmware up-to-date with the latest security patches.
  Monitor network traffic with IDS or IPS systems.
  Educate users and staff about security risks and best practices. </p>

  <h3> running scanning tools </h3>
  <img src="images/r1.jpg" alt="cc"/> 
  <h4>reflection</h4>
  <p> Running scanning tools is a crucial aspect of network security. These tools are designed to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential entry points that could be exploited by attackers. By conducting regular scans, organizations can proactively discover and address security weaknesses, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Scanning tools, such as port scanners, vulnerability scanners, and network mappers, provide valuable insights into the security posture of a network. They help administrators prioritize security measures, apply patches, and implement necessary safeguards to protect critical systems and data. Running scanning tools is an essential practice for maintaining a robust and secure network infrastructure.</p>
  <h3>exploiting a website using sql injection</h3>
  <img src="images/w1.jpg" alt="cc"/>
  <h4>reflection</h4>
  <p> Instead of using SQL injection, one alternative method for interacting with a database securely is by utilizing parameterized queries or prepared statements. These methods involve separating the SQL code from the data input by using placeholders or parameters. The actual values are then provided separately, ensuring that they are treated as data and not as part of the SQL code itself. This approach helps prevent malicious SQL code injection because the database system knows how to distinguish between the SQL code and the data being supplied. Parameterized queries or prepared statements are supported by most programming languages and database frameworks, making them a widely adopted and recommended method for secure database interactions.</p>
